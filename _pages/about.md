I am currently doing a PhD  in Computer Science at the University of Manchester, supervised by [Prof. Xiao-Jun Zeng](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=jb-bYtIAAAAJ&hl=en) and co-supervised by [Dr. Ke Chen](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=-pGdSi4AAAAJ&hl=en). I graduated from Wuhan University with a MSc in Management Science and Engineering in 2022 and from Wuhan University of Technology with an BSc in Management Information Systems in 2019.


My research has focused primarily on muti-agent reinforcement learning and its applications to the evolution of cooperation. During my master, I have been looking at how social exclusion and expulsion mechanisms can lead to the emergence and evolution of cooperation. Currently, I'm looking to analyze the difference in the performance of cooperative facilitation mechanisms under social learning and reinforcement learning.
