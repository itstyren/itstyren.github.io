I am currently doing a PhD  in Computer Science at the University of Manchester, supervised by [Prof. Xiao-Jun Zeng](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=jb-bYtIAAAAJ&hl=en) and co-supervised by [Dr. Ke Chen](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=-pGdSi4AAAAJ&hl=en). I graduated from Wuhan University with an MSc in Management Science and Engineering in 2022 and from Wuhan University of Technology with a BSc in Management Information Systems in 2019.


My research has focused primarily on muti-agent reinforcement learning and its applications to the evolution of cooperation. During my master's program, I investigated the role of social exclusion and expulsion mechanisms in driving the emergence and evolution of cooperation. Presently, I am conducting an analysis to compare the performance of cooperative facilitation mechanisms when applied within the contexts of social learning and reinforcement learning.
