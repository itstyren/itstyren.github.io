This study presents a novel **feature-driven hybrid attention model** for accurate water quality prediction. It combines the **Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)** using linguistic terms with weakened hedges for robust feature selection, with a **dual-attention mechanism** integrating graph attention and Informer-based self-attention modules.

Applied to datasets from the Yellow River Basin, the model outperforms eight baselines with up to **68% improved accuracy** and **91.6% reduction in error**. This framework provides critical insights for sustainable water management under climate change scenarios.
